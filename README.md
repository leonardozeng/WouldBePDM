# WouldBePDM
"Would-Be PDM" (I whish a was a PDM) is a light software to manage CAD files trhought svn.

Now it is being rewritten using sharpdevelop ( http://www.icsharpcode.net/opensource/sd/ ).

The rest is a group of CATIA macros for manage CATIA projects via SVN using tortoise.

Instruction will come.

Enjoy Roberto
