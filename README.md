# WouldBePDM
"Would-Be PDM" (I whish a was a PDM) is a light software to manage CAD files through svn.

Now it has been rewritten using sharpdevelop ( http://www.icsharpcode.net/opensource/sd/ ).

The rest is a group of CATIA macros for manage CATIA projects via SVN using tortoise.

Instruction will come (temporally read Would-be PDM_instructions.pdf).

Enjoy Roberto

PS. In the "releases" tag you can find the installer
